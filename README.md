# Voice Recognition: Poems
Playing with Chrome's voice recognition and text-to-speech APIs. Issue a vocal command, and the browser reads the requested poem aloud.

##Next steps:
- Hook up to our database of poems, or integrate with a web-scraper to find poems online that match the user's vocal input. Could spit back an array with "Did you mean [x], or [y], ...?".
